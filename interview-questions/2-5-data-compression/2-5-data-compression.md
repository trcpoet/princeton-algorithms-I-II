# Interview Questions: Data Compression

## Ternary Huffman codes

**Question**. Generalize the Huffman algorithm to codewords over the ternary alphabet (0, 1, and 2) instead of the binary alphabet. That is, given a bytestream, find a prefix-free ternary code that uses as few trits (0s, 1s, and 2s) as possible. Prove that it yields optimal prefix-free ternary code.

**Answer**.

## Optimality

**Question**.     

- Identify an optimal uniquely-decodable code that is neither prefix free nor suffix tree.
- Identify two optimal prefix-free codes for the same input that have a different distribution of codeword lengths.

**Answer**.

## Move-to-front coding

**Question**. Design an algorithm to implement move-to-front encoding so that each operation takes logarithmic time in the worst case. That is, maintain alphabet of symbols in a list. A symbol is encoded as the number of symbols that precede it in the list. After encoding a symbol, move it to the front of the list.

**Answer**.
