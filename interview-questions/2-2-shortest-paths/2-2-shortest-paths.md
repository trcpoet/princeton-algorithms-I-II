# Interview Questions: Shortest Paths

## Monotonic shortest path

**Question**. Given an edge-weighted digraph G, design an ElogE algorithm to find a monotonic shortest path from s to every other vertex. A path is monotonic if the sequence of edge weights along the path are either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.

**Answer**.

## Second shortest path

**Question**. Given an edge-weighted digraph and let P be a shortest path from vertex s to vertex t. Design an E log V algorithm to find a path other than P from s to t that is as short as possible. Assume all of the edge weights are strictly positive.

**Answer**.

## Shortest path with one skippable edge

**Question**. Given an edge-weighted digraph, design an E log V algorithm to find a shortest path from s to t where you can change the weight of any one edge to zero. Assume the edge weights are nonnegative.

**Answer**.
