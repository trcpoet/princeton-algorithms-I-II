# Interview Questions: Regular Expressions

## Challenging REs

**Question**. Construct a regular expression for each of the following languages over the binary alphabet or prove that no such regular expression is possible:

```
 All strings except 11 or 111.
 Strings with 1 in every odd-number bit position.
 Strings with an equal number of 0s and 1s.
 Strings with at least two 0s and at most one 1.
 Strings that when interpreted as a binary integer are a multiple of 3.
 Strings with no two consecutive 1s.
 Strings that are palindromes (same forwards and backwards).
 Strings with an equal number of substrings of the form 01 and 10.
```
