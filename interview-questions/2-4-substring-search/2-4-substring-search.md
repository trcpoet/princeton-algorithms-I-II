## Cyclic rotation of a string

**Question**. A string s is a cyclic rotation of a string t if s and t have the same length and s consists of a suffix of t followed by a prefix of t. For example, "winterbreak" is a cyclic rotation of "breakwinter" (and vice versa). Design a linear-time algorithm to determine whether one string is a cyclic rotation of another.

## Tandem repeat

**Question**. A tandem repeat of a base string b within a string s is a substring of s consisting of at least one consecutive copy of the base string b. Given b and s, design an algorithm to find a tandem repeat of b within s of maximum length. Your algorithm should run in time proportional to M+N, where M is length of b and N is the length s. For example, if s is "abcabcababcaba" and b is "abcab", then "abcababcab" is the tandem substring of maximum length (2 copies).

## Longest palindromic substring

**Question**. Given a string s, find the longest substring that is a palindrome in expected linearithmic time. Signing bonus: Do it in linear time in the worst case.
