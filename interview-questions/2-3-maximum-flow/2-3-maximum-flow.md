# Interview Questions: Maximum Flow

## Fattest path

**Question**. Given an edge-weighted digraph and two vertices s and t, design an E log E algorithm to find a fattest path from s to t. The bottleneck capacity of a path is the minimum weight of an edge on the path. A fattest path is a path such that no other path has a higher bottleneck capacity.

**Answer**.

## Perfect matchings in k-regular bipartite graphs

**Question**. Suppose that there are n men and n women at a dance and that each man knows exactly k women and each woman knows exactly k men (and relationships are mutual). Show that it is always possible to arrange a dance so that each man and woman are matched with someone they know.

**Answer**.

## Maximum weight closure problem

**Question**. A subset of vertices S in a digraph is closed if there are no edges pointing from S to a vertex outside S. Given a digraph with weights (positive or negative) on the vertices, find a closed subset of vertices of maximum total weight.
