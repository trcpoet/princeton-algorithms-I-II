# Interview Questions: Hash Tables 

## 4-SUM

**Question**. Given an array a[] of n integers, the 4-SUM problem is to determine if  there exist distinct indices i, j, k, and l such that  a[i]+a[j]=a[k]+a[l]. Design an algorithm for the 4-SUM problem that takes time proportional to n^2 under suitable technical assumptions).

**Answer**.

## Hashing with wrong hashCode() or equals()

**Question**. Suppose that you implement a data type OlympicAthlete for use in a java.util.HashMap.

- Describe what happens if you override hashCode() but not equals().
- Describe what happens if you override equals() but not hashCode().
- Describe what happens if you override hashCode() but implement public boolean equals(OlympicAthlete that) instead of public boolean equals(Object that).

**Answer**.
