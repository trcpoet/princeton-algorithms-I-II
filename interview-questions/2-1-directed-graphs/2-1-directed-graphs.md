# Interview Questions: Directed Graphs

## Shortest directed cycle

**Question**. Given a digraph G, design an efficient algorithm to find a directed  cycle with the minimum number of edges (or report that the graph is  acyclic). The running time of your algorithm should be at most  proportional to V(E+V) and use space proportional to E+V, where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.

**Answer**.

## Hamiltonian path in a DAG

**Question**. Given a directed acyclic graph, design a linear-time algorithm to  determine whether it has a Hamiltonian path (a simple path that visits  every vertex), and if so, find one.

**Answer**.

## Reachable vertex

**Question**. 

- DAG: Design a linear-time algorithm to determine whether a DAG has a vertex that is reachable from every other vertex, and if so, find one.
- Digraph: Design a linear-time algorithm to determine whether a digraph has a vertex that is reachable from every other vertex, and if so, find one.
