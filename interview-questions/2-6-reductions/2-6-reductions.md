# Interview Questions: Reductions

## Longest path and longest cycle

**Question**. Consider the following two problems

- LongestPath: Given an undirected graph G and two distinct vertices s and t, find a simple path (no repeated vertices) between s and t with the most edges.
- LongestCycle: Given an undirected graph Gâ€², find a simple cycle (no repeated vertices or edges except the first and last vertex) with the most edges.

Show that LongestPath linear-time reduces to LongestCycle.

**Answer**.

## 3Sum and 4Sum

**Question**.  Consider the following two problems:

- 3Sum: Given an integer array a, are there three distinct indices i, j, and k such that a_i + a_j + a_k = 0=0?
- 4Sum: Given an integer array b, are there four distinct integers i, j, k, and l such that b_i + b_j + b_k + b_l = 0?

Show that 3Sum linear-time reduces to 4Sum.

**Answer**.

## 3Sum and 3Linear

**Question**. Consider the following two problems:

- 3Linear: Given an integer array aa, are there three indices (not necessarily distinct) i, j, and k such that a_i + a_j = 8*a_k?
- 3Sum: Given an integer array bb, are there three indices (not necessarily distinct) i, j, and k such that b_i + b_j + b_k = 0?

Show that 3Linear linear-time reduces to 3Sum.
