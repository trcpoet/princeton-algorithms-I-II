# Interview Questions: Minimum Spanning Trees

## Bottleneck minimum spanning tree

**Question**. Given a connected edge-weighted graph, design an efficient algorithm to  find a minimum bottleneck spanning tree. The bottleneck capacity of a  spanning tree is the weights of its largest edge. A minimum bottleneck spanning tree is a spanning tree of minimum bottleneck capacity.

**Answer**.

## Is an edge in a MST

**Question**. Given an edge-weighted graph G and an edge e, design a linear-time algorithm to determine whether e appears in some MST of G.

> Note: Since your algorithm must take linear time in the worst case, you cannot afford to compute the MST itself.

**Answer**.

## Minimum-weight feedback edge set

**Question**.  A feedback edge set of a graph is a subset of edges that contains at  least one edge from every cycle in the graph. If the edges of a feedback edge set are removed, the resulting graph is acyclic. Given an edge-weighted graph, design an efficient algorithm to find a feedback  edge set of minimum weight. Assume the edge weights are positive.

**Answer**.
