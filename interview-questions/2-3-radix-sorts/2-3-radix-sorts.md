# Interview Questions: Radix Sorts

## 2-sum

**Question**. Given an array a of n 64-bit integers and a target value T, determine whether there are two distinct integers i and j such that a_i + a_j =T. Your algorithm should run in linear time in the worst case.

**Answer**.

## American flag sort

**Question**. Given an array of n objects with integer keys between 0 and Râˆ’1, design a linear-time algorithm to rearrange them in ascending order. Use extra space at most proportional to R.

**Answer**.

## Cyclic rotations

**Question**. Two strings s and t are cyclic rotations of one another if they have the same length and s consists of a suffix of t followed  by a prefix of t. For example, "suffixsort" and "sortsuffix" are cyclic rotations.
Given n distinct strings, each of length L, design an algorithm to determine whether there exists a pair of distinct strings that are  cyclic rotations of one another. For example, the following list of n = 12n=12 strings of length L = 10L=10 contains exactly one pair of strings ("suffixsort" and "sortsuffix") that are cyclic rotations of one  another.

The order of growth of the running time should be nL^2 (or better) in the worst case. Assume that the alphabet size R is a small constant. Signing bonus. Do it in nL time in the worst case.
