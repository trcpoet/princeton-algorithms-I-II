# Interview Questions: Linear Programming

## Feasibility detection. 

**Question**. Suppose that you want to solve a linear program but you don't have a starting initial basic feasible solution—perhaps the all 0 vector is not feasible. Design a related linear program whose solution will be a basic feasible solution to the original linear program (assuming the original linear program has a basic feasible solution). 

**Answer**.

## Detecting unboundedness

**Question**. Describe how to modify the simplex algorithm to detect an unbounded linear program—a linear program in which there is a feasible solution that makes the objective function arbitrarily large.

**Answer**.

## Birkhoff-von Neumann theorem. 

**Question**. Consider the polyhedron P defined by ∑i Xij = 1, ∑j Xij = 1 ; Xij≥0.  Prove that all extreme points of P have integer coordinates (0 or 1).

**Answer**.
